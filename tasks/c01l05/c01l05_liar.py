# Perform a task called liar. This is a mechanism that says off topic 1/3 of the time. Your task is to send your
# question in English (any question, e.g. "What is capital of Poland?") to the endpoint /task/ in a field named
# 'question' (POST method, as a regular form field, NOT JSON). The API system will answer that question (in the 'answer'
# field) or start telling you about something completely different, changing the subject.
#
# Your task is to write a filtering system (Guardrails) that will determine (YES/NO) whether the answer is on topic.
# Then return your verdict to the checking system as a single YES/NO word.
# If you retrieve the content of the task through the API without sending any additional parameters,
# you will get a set of prompts.
# How to know if the answer is 'on topic'?
# If your question # was about the capital of Poland, and in the answer you receive a list of monuments in Rome,
# the answer to send to the API is NO
